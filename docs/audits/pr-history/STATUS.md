Repairs use focused commits and independent main-based PR branches. Commit IDs, local test evidence, current heads and CI check URLs are in repairs.json. A pending CI result is not a passing check; source evidence is separate from deployment, packaging and hardware qualification.

The chronological unstarted cursor is #91; 57 earlier partial scopes also remain. Finish pending repair publication and CI, then take the next bounded audit slice with a lane for the oldest real code-review gap.

0 of 12 repair groups have completed the entire review/publication/CI cycle. Review follow-ups, unpublished commits, stale review heads and closed-unmerged PRs remain blockers even if an older CI run is green.
