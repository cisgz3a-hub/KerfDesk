# Agent Handoff

This file captures the current continuation state for Claude Code or any other
AI coding agent that picks up the LaserForge roadmap work without access to the
chat transcript.

## Current State

- Branch: `master`.
- Repo state at handoff: clean; local `master` equals `origin/master`.
- Current HEAD when this handoff was written: hash-fill commit on top of
  `68d948a9` (`feat(safety): T1-193 — MachineEventLedger schema +
  write path (foundation slice)`). Always verify live HEAD with
  `git log --oneline -1` before editing.
- Last shipped roadmap item: **T1-193** (external-audit Critical #14
  foundation — `MachineEventLedger` schema + write path). This
  session-arc shipped **33 consecutive audit-driven tickets**
  (T1-161 → T1-193): 12 internal + 5 external-Critical + 6 external-
  High + 5 deferred-Medium/Low (T1-183 → T1-188) + 5 deferred-multi-
  week-foundation (T1-189 R-mode arcs, T1-190 SceneSerializer any-
  cleanup, T1-191 burn-envelope divergence UI, T1-192 FirmwareAdapter
  type contract, T1-193 MachineEventLedger). The first
  12 (T1-161 → T1-172) addressed findings from the internal audit
  (`docs/AUDIT-2026-05-11.md`); the next 11 (T1-173 → T1-182)
  addressed the external audit (response received 2026-05-11) — both
  its 5 Critical findings AND its 6 High-severity architectural items:
  - **Critical** (T1-173 → T1-176): raster overscan as S0 travel,
    WCS query error fails closed, emergencyStop + disconnect preserve
    unsafe state, failed-start preserves unsafe state when streamed.
  - **High** (T1-177 → T1-182): fill silent fallback to outline
    tracing → thrown error (T1-177); controller numeric validation
    at the boundary (T1-178); tab gaps use G1 feed not G0 rapid
    (T1-179); G-code emitter purity (zero-distance suppression +
    footer-preview state snapshot) (T1-180); compile determinism
    via entitlement + material-preset hashes attached to the ticket
    (T1-181); canonical burn-envelope parser for the EMITTED gcode
    (T1-182).
  Each ticket landed as a coupled triple. TS baseline 0 errors
  maintained across every commit. Full Critical / High coverage list:
  - **T1-173** (external Critical #1): raster overscan as S0 travel.
    Pre-T1-173 a 3mm overscan engraved 3mm beyond the artwork on every
    segment edge — the laser fired outside the intended image.
  - **T1-174** (external Critical #5): WCS query error fails closed.
    Pre-T1-174 a `$#` error response called `skipWcsNormalization()`
    which marked placement TRUSTED — saved-origin jobs could start
    from an unknown WCS offset.
  - **T1-175** (external Critical #2 + #3): emergencyStop + disconnect-
    during-job preserve the unsafe-prior-state flag. Pre-T1-175 both
    paths unconditionally cleared the flag → next launch wouldn't
    surface a recovery dialog even after E-stop mid-burn.
  - **T1-176** (external Critical #4): failed-start preserves unsafe-
    state when ANY streaming evidence exists. Pre-T1-176 the catch
    cleared the flag based on "exception = job never started" — but
    if `executeJob` set `_isJobRunning=true` and wrote header lines
    BEFORE throwing, the recovery flag was lost.
  Each ticket landed as a coupled triple: code change + regression
  test + ROADMAP.md entry with verification, followed by the hash-
  fill commit. TS baseline 0 errors maintained across every commit.
- Remaining work: every audit finding now has either a code fix OR
  a documented foundation slice + named-deferred follow-up. The
  remaining work is **multi-week implementation arcs** on top of
  the foundations T1-192 / T1-193 shipped:
  - **GrblAdapter implementing FirmwareAdapter** — wire the new
    type contract (T1-192) over the existing GrblController +
    GrblOutputStrategy code; replace `controllerType: 'grbl'` on
    `ValidatedJobTicket` with `firmware: FirmwareAdapter['id']`;
    introduce `FirmwareRegistry`.
  - **MarlinAdapter / RuidaAdapter** — first real non-GRBL
    firmware-support PRs, each one implements the full
    `FirmwareAdapter` contract.
  - **Wire production code to the MachineEventLedger** — every
    site that currently emits a `console.warn` about a safety
    event (T1-29 setUnsafePriorState, T1-174 WCS query error,
    T1-175 emergencyStop/disconnect, T1-176 failed-start, T1-188
    burn-envelope divergence) calls `ledger.append({...})`. The
    full SafetySupervisor centralization is the umbrella ticket.
  - **Full `CompileInputSnapshot` refactor** of `JobCompiler` to
    remove all global reads (T1-181 ships the detection gate; the
    compiler still calls `canUseFeature()` / `getActiveProfile()`
    / `getPresetById()` directly).
  - **Affine raster sampling** — emitting actual rotated scanlines
    so rotated raster images compile (T1-187 closes the safety gap
    with a fail-closed throw today).
  - **Preview UI rebuild** to consume `ValidatedJobTicket.
    emittedBurnBounds` from T1-182 + the canonical motion stream
    from `analyzeEmittedBurnEnvelope` — the SimulationRenderer
    still reads from `Plan`.

  Internal audit findings: ALL CLEARED. The internal audit ledger
  has no remaining open Medium/Low items.
  Medium / High blocked by integration work: F-002 (Connection-
  GenerationGuard primitive shipped but never wired), F-004 (T1-22
  ForceSafeState orchestration — needs hardware), F-018 (T3-57
  CapabilityMismatchRules unwired), F-050 (diagnostics cluster
  wiring).

## What To Read First

1. `CLAUDE.md`
2. `.cursor/rules/laserforge.md`
3. `docs/ROADMAP.md`
4. `docs/ROADMAP-shipped-audit.md`
5. `PROJECT_MAP.md`

The roadmap is current through T3-43 (first slice). Use the master checklist
at the bottom of `docs/ROADMAP.md` for current open-ticket counts. Some
historical "Open" sections in `docs/ROADMAP-shipped-audit.md` are audit
evidence from 2026-04-30 and must not be treated as current planning counts —
the planning note at the top of that file (commit `bcd31c2`) explains.

## T3-43 / T3-44 — what shipped, what was deferred

**T3-43** first slice covers four of the five T3-43 categories using pure
capability fixtures plus the existing operation gate (`canExecuteOperation`
/ T2-40):

- Operation routing (T2-26): `GrblController.operations.{jog,home,unlockAlarm,
  frame,testFire,laserOff}` source-pinned as semantic methods.
- Capability gating (T2-25): per-family allow/refuse decisions across GRBL,
  Marlin-shape, Ruida-shape, file-upload, and no-output fixtures.
- Output-format gating (T2-29): `job-start` refuses when no executable output
  is advertised.
- Profile-override propagation (T2-25): `applyProfileOverrides` flips
  capability decisions without mutating static capabilities.
- GRBL regression: `grblCapabilities` still advertises gcode-text/line-stream/
  M3+M4/M5/ok-line and the full operator operations set.

T3-43 deferred: profile / controller-family transport mismatch (T2-30 Falcon
WiFi as real transport — still blocked on real WiFi controller plumbing) and
live `FakeMarlinController` / `FakeBinaryController` production stubs (the
capability fixtures cover the contract surface without duplicating controller
plumbing; add only when a non-GRBL controller actually ships).

**T3-44** first slice ships only the type foundation in
`src/controllers/JobProgressMultiDomain.ts`: `JobPhase`, `ProgressUnit`,
`GrblHealth`, `MultiDomainJobProgress`, plus three constructors / converters
(`toMultiDomainGrblProgress` losslessly maps the legacy GRBL shape;
`makeUploadProgress` builds the `unit:'byte'` upload shape with input
clamping; `makeDeviceReportedProgress` builds the Ruida-style
`unit:'device-reported'` shape with percentComplete clamped to [0, 100]) and
type-narrowing guards (`hasGrblHealth`, `hasCountProgress`, `isActivePhase`,
`isTerminalPhase`). The module is intentionally type-only — the test file
source-pins that it does not import from `GrblController` or `MachineService`.

T3-44 deferred: migrating `GrblController` progress emission to the
multi-domain shape, threading the new shape through
`MachineService.onProgress` callbacks, and replacing UI rendering in
`ConnectionPanel` / `Progress.tsx` to gate the GRBL-health panel on
`hasGrblHealth(progress)`. Same gating rule as T3-43: do these only when a
non-GRBL controller actually ships, and file each as a fresh T3-44
follow-up commit rather than re-opening the master-checklist line.

## Continuation Notes

- Do not merge Dependabot PRs blindly. Most open Dependabot PRs had failing
  checks at the prior handoff.
- Dependabot PR #3 was green on GitHub, but a local no-commit test merge was
  aborted because full `npm test` timed out, and a direct run of
  `tests/end-to-end-workflows/end-to-end-workflows.test.ts` also timed out.
- On clean `master`, `npm ci` completed and
  `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` passed.

## What's blocked and why

After this session's run, the remaining open lines on the master
checklist all hit a real blocker. A future session that wants to
make further progress needs one of the following inputs:

**Hardware verification (10 T1 tickets):** T1-17, T1-28, T1-31,
T1-34, T1-36, T1-39, T1-40, T1-41, T1-42, T1-51. Each has code
shipped and pinned by tests; the close-out gate is a Falcon A1 Pro
burn / connect / frame test that a software-only agent cannot
perform.

**Hardware investigation required:** T2-30 Falcon WiFi as real
controller, T3-17 Wi-Fi safety model, T3-12 hardware-in-the-loop
test framework. These need someone to capture the real Falcon WiFi
protocol (HTTP + WebSocket message shapes, file-upload semantics,
progress callbacks) on real hardware before any production code
can land safely.

**External / business decisions:** T3-4 (code-signing certs from
Apple / Microsoft), T3-84 (Linux packaging — explicit "defer until
business decides"), T3-85 (release-time installer QA matrix),
T2-95 (real trial model — gated on monetization decision).

**Multi-week refactor:** T2-6 App.tsx file split (still 1987 lines
after 19 phases). Each remaining phase is a discrete extraction
that needs careful before/after verification — not safe to ship
quickly. T3-34 (stripe-based raster) depends on the live emitter
migration of T3-15 (multi-week itself).

## Expected Next Step

Pick one of the blockers above with the right input, or take a
T2/T3 follow-up not in the master checklist (e.g., wire the
T3-91 banner into `ConnectionPanelMain`, or wire the T3-90
Settings UI checkbox).

## Hardware verification still owed before release tagging

- T3-48 device-reuse flow: connect, disconnect, reconnect on
  Falcon A1 Pro; confirm second connect prompt is not shown.
- T3-50 device identity capture: confirm `[VER:1.1h:]` parses on
  the real Falcon and `getDeviceIdentity()` returns expected
  fields after a real connect.
- T3-55 Falcon autofocus firmware gate: once a profile-load
  caller threads the live firmware version through, confirm
  autofocus is correctly gated on a known-old firmware build.
- T3-90 auto-M5: enable `autoM5OnConnect` in a profile, connect,
  and confirm M5 lands shortly after the first idle status.

## Foundation slices shipped without caller migration

Many of this session's slices landed only the contract surface
(types + comparators + selectors + helpers) with explicit caller-
migration follow-ups deferred. Watch for those in future sessions:

  - T3-44 progress emission: `GrblController` emit + UI render.
  - T3-46 split-profile storage migration when a non-GRBL
    profile lands.
  - T3-50 mandatory-fail handshake when T2-32 ConnectionManager
    lands.
  - T3-51 IdentitySnapshot persistence + ConnectionManager wiring.
  - T3-55 profile-load callers thread live firmware version.
  - T3-57 `runPreflight` threads `getDeviceIdentity` through
    `PreflightContext`.
  - T3-83 signed-token / clock-rollback / monkey-patch defenses
    once T2-90 / T2-91 / T2-94 ship.
  - T3-86 Playwright runner once T2-98 CI runners land.
  - T3-87 wire selectors into `JobLog.ts` / `JobReplay.ts`.
  - T3-88 behavioral end-to-end fuzz once T2-122 typed-IPC.
  - T3-89 dedicated `.github/workflows/security-checks.yml` once
    T2-99 / T2-100 release signing infrastructure ships.
  - T3-90 Settings UI checkbox + explanatory text in the
    device-profile editor.
  - T3-91 wire `<UnsafeAtConnectBanner>` into `ConnectionPanelMain`
    and the recovery-action handler dispatcher.
  - T3-24 bundled calibrated curves once a contributor with
    real material data submits via the now-shipped pipeline.
  - T3-15 live emitter / ticket / controller / preview
    migration to `AsyncIterable<GcodeChunk>` (multi-week each).
